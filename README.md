# DNN-Speech-Recognizer

We begin by investigating the LibriSpeech dataset that will be used to train and evaluate your models. Your algorithm will first convert any raw audio to feature representations that are commonly used for ASR. You will then move on to building neural networks that can map these audio features to transcribed text. After learning about the basic types of layers that are often used for deep learning-based approaches to ASR, you will engage in your own investigations by creating and testing your own state-of-the-art models.

In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline! Your completed pipeline will accept raw audio as input and return a predicted transcription of the spoken language. The full pipeline is summarized in the figure below.

STEP 1 is a pre-processing step that converts raw audio to one of two feature representations that are commonly used for ASR.
STEP 2 is an acoustic model which accepts audio features as input and returns a probability distribution over all potential transcriptions. After learning about the basic types of neural networks that are often used for acoustic modeling, you will engage in your own investigations, to design your own acoustic model!
STEP 3 in the pipeline takes the output from the acoustic model and returns a predicted transcription.
